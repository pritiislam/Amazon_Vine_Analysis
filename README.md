# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
AWS/ Postgres/ ETL

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are required to publish a review. 

## Results
* There were 33 Vine reviews and 45388 non-Vine reviews. 
* There were 15 5-star Vine reviews and 23733 5-star non-Vine reviews.
* 45.45% of Vine reviews were 5-star and 52.29% of non-Vine reviews were 5-star. 

## Summary 
In summary, there were 46909 total reviews posted on the site, while 23991 of the reviews were 5-star reviews. Additionally, our findings show 45.45% of Vine reviews and 52.29% of non-Vine reviews as 5-star. These numbers shows an even split between 5-star reviews and all other reviews for both Vine and non-Vine members. Therefore, there does not seem to be any bias for reviews through the Vine program.
